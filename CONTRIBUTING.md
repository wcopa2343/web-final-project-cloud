## Branching

## Branching Workflow

We follow the
[Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).
The Feature Branch Workflow assumes a central repository, and master represents
the official project history. Instead of committing directly on their local
master branch, developers create a new branch every time they start work on a
new feature

## Merge Request Process

1. Create a branch from the master branch (latest version)
2. Implement feature or fix
3. Ensure all tests are passing locally (`yarn test`)
4. Ensure are the linting checks pass locally (`yarn lint`)
5. Raise a new merge request pointing to master branch
6. Assign a meaningful title
7. Document the changes
8. Double-check your create your merge request
9. Assign appropriate team members for review
10. Squash and merge the branch, to have a cleaner history of commits
